1. create barebones main game page where user can select cards and they will pop up and display what type of hand they are.

2. 52 buttons, 1 for each card, click a button and it starts building a hand until reaching 5 cards or after clicking a "create hand" button and at every addition it prints the hand representation

3. store these hands in visual list

4. be able to click on any of the hands in the list and the buttons corresponding to the cards in the selected hand get highlighted

5. make more than 1 unique user be able to do the above independently, i.e. each user has their own list of hands
    - actually do this earlier lol
