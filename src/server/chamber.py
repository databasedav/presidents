        Here it is important to note that we do not need to deselect the

        Cards that are to be removed will not always be the in the
        current hand, e.g. during trading I imagine many people will
        just let the game default to giving the asking player the
        lowest matching card.

        be in the hand but this should be empirically verified and the
