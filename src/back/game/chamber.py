class Chamber:
    """
    Storage for cards and hands specifically designed for fast runtimes
    in context of front end interaction. Base class for EmittingChamber.

    Uses doubly linked list because node removal is constant time.

    Runtime errors when attempting operation that involves a card that
    is not in the chamber; is not an assertion because such an operation
    could reasonably not be the result of a bug, e.g. not knowing
    whether a card is in the chamber or a DOM modification.

    For operations that involve more than one card at a time, checks
    that all the cards are in the chamber before proceeding to avoid
    having to undo link operations.
